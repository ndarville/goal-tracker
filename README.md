Goal Tracker
============
Track the goals, promises, and predictions of those we want to hold accountable. Inspired by [trudeaumetre.ca][].

This was initially whipped up quickly to serve as [the Indian counterpart to trudeaumetre][indiantracker], but is perfectly serviceable for other uses.

Consult the [documentation][] for more information on how this works.
